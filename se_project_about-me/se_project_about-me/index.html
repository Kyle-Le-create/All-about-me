     <h2 class="card-title">Friends</h2>
<p class="card-text">My friends grew up with me in a small town called Ocean Springs, Mississippi and we all went to college together at the University of South Alabama. Some of them became chemical engineers, others are pursuing dentist and I got my bachelor degree in exercise science. But I realize that I didn't like my job where I was at than realize that I was good with computers and started the program with tripleten. </p>

     <h2 class="card-title">Fishing</h2>
<p class="card-text">I am a outdoors man since I was a young boy. My dad taught me everything from the woods, to the waters, to hunting, and fishing. But fishing was my favorite, because it is peaceful and I feel connected with nature and the animals around me. Being on the water makes me feel home and all my problems just disappear. Nowadays people forgot how beautiful nature is and not enjoying its natural beauty. </p>

     <h2 class="card-title">Muay thai</h2>
<p class="card-text">I started doing muay thai since my freshman year in college. First, I started doing boxing for footwork and punching control, than I did wrestling to practice grappling. But my boxing coach suggested I should do muay thai and I know so little about this martial art. When I first started it was a lot of conditioning and jump roping. Than I realize it was a lot of kicking and elblows, because muay thai is the art of the eight limbs. I feel in love with the sport and respected my coach for teaching me to be discipline towards my training, school and my life.</p>
